# GuesstheNumber
The app randomly chooses a number between 1 and 1000 and the user has to guess the correct value. Every time the user enters a wrong value, the app will say whether that answer was too high or too low. The app window will also turn red (warmer) if the user is getting closer to the value or blue (colder) if they are getting further away. When the correct value has been guessed, the app outputs a "Correct!" and the window turns white.
